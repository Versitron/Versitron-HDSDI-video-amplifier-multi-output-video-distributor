## What Is a Video Amplifier?

A **video amplifier** (also called a video signal booster) strengthens video signals to overcome losses caused by long cable runs, multiple connections, or signal splitting. They maintain original image quality by ensuring proper signal amplitude and impedance matching.

## Distribution Functions

- **Signal Boosting** – Maintains video quality over extended cable lengths.
- **Multi-Output Distribution** – Sends one video input to multiple monitors, recorders, or switchers.
- **Signal Splitting** – Distributes the same feed to several devices without degradation.
- **Routing & Hub Operations** – Organizes and sends video signals across large facilities.
